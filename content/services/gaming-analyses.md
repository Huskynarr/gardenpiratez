## Market Report
A market analysis is often purely quantitative and not qualitative. However, with our advanced reports, you can make a more detailed comparison with competitors. Our market reports take into account both quantitative and qualitative aspects and provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the market, trends and your position compared to your competitors.

## In-game analysis
In-game analysis can be very time-consuming, as every player interaction must be captured and analyzed. Thanks to our comprehensive in-game analytics, developers can determine if certain features are used frequently, what bug fixes are needed, and which best sellers can be identified more accurately. Our in-game analytics save time and resources by providing detailed information about user behavior, game content popularity, and potential improvements that can contribute to an optimized player experience and a successful product.
