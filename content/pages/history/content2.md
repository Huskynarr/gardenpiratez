We took over our first game back in 2012. This game was fundamentally modernized and expanded. The success led to the takeover of a second game already two years later. One year later, we founded our first news magazine with a focus on IT, technology and business. We expanded our reach with exclusive reports and news. After the success, in 2016 we found potential opportunities in the Xbox sector and founded a specialized magazine for developers here. From 2017, we started to keep our own databases and in the following years, we expanded our analysis and tracking capabilities. Since 2019, we have been using appropriate Big Data tools to keep up with scaling.
